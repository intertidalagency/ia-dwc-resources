## Why Darwin Core? 

There is an existing standard, Darwin Core, that works well for sharing many types of biological data, especially those that are related to ecology. It's been around for about 25 years and at least 3.5 billion data records are shared via Darwin Core to repositories like the [Ocean Biodiversity Information System (OBIS)](https://obis.org/).   

For communities like those which have developed around offshore development, this means the data you help collect can travel further and be reused more quickly. More practically, Darwin Core also saves time for anyone managing data, because it cuts down on the cleaning and translation work usually needed to merge different formats. In short, it helps your data stay connected, useful, and impactful well beyond the original project.

## Darwin Core Basics

### Terms you can use

Darwin Core is essentially a list of terms you can use as column headers in your data. Of course, these can also be used in more sophisticated structures than spreadsheets, but let's keep it simple for now.  

For example,In Darwin Core, `countryCode` is  a standard term that describes that a particular observation happened in a country. You describe them via two-letter country codes (like `US` for the United States or `CA` for Canada). 

Although there are many good arguments for using standards early in your data workflow, you don’t have create an entirely new workflow; you can map to `countryCode`, and other Darwin Core terms, anywhere in your data process. That way, whether you’re collecting records in the field, managing them in a database, or publishing them online, the meaning stays consistent and others will immediately understand what that field represents.

### What is required?

One of the most frequent questions we get is which terms are required in Darwin Core? The answer is none. The standard does not presribe requirements, however repositories like OBIS and GBIF do.

For example, OBIS requires:

   -  `eventID`
   -  `eventDate`
   -  `decimalLatitude`
   -  `decimalLongitude`
   -  `occurrenceID`
   -  `occurrenceStatus` (e.g. present/absent)
   -  `basisOfRecord` (e.g. HumanObservation)
   -  `scientificName`

When you look at those requirements, they're rather simple: What did you see (`scientificName`), when (`eventDate`) and where (`decimalLatitude/decimalLongtitude`) did you see it, how did you see it (`basisOfRecord`), and how do we reference this record (`eventID` and `occurrenceID`).

But if that's all the information Darwin Core communicated, it wouldn't be very useful.  On the next page we look at some specific examples.  It comes down to what your scientific community expects of you. For example, it might be normal to collect the `sex` of the species in your field. In that case, it's best to include `sex` as a term.

### The Darwin Core Archive

The Darwin Core Archive is the practical, long-lasting “package” for sharing biodiversity data. It is a zip file, ready to stand the test of time. Inside are tables of data (e.g. CSV files) where the columns are Darwin Core terms, describing record-level details (like species names, dates, and locations).  A separate EML file (Ecological Metadata Language) provides the dataset-level story—who collected it, when, why, and how the pieces belong together. This combination makes the archive both technically solid and human-understandable, ensuring your data remains useful well into the future.

### What about things that don't fit into Darwin Core?

Invariably, scientists measure variables that are unique to their data. So how do we share these in a standardized way?  The folks at OBIS came up with a nice extension to Darwin Core that does just that, it's called the `Extended measurement or fact (eMoF)` extension.

As you'll seen on the example from the Animal Telemetry Network (ATN), sometimes communities have strong standards in place, like the [Movebank attribute dictionary](https://www.movebank.org/cms/movebank-content/movebank-attribute-dictionary), which prescribes standard definitions for variables related to telemetry.  The eMoF extension allows for these to be put into a generalized, standard structure so that they can interoperate, and be reused with standards from other communities, like the [Climate and Forecast (CF) Standard Names](https://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/P07/current/) 

### What kind of things do fit?

In fact, here are some of the data types that have already used Darwin Core to publish to repositories like OBIS and GBIF.
