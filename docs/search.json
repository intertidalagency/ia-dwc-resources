    "text": "Why Darwin Core?\nThere is an existing standard, Darwin Core, that works well for sharing many types of biological data, especially those that are related to ecology. It’s been around for about 25 years and at least 3.5 billion data records are shared via Darwin Core to repositories like the Ocean Biodiversity Information System (OBIS).\nFor communities like those which have developed around offshore development, this means the data you help collect can travel further and be reused more quickly. More practically, Darwin Core also saves time for anyone managing data, because it cuts down on the cleaning and translation work usually needed to merge different formats. In short, it helps your data stay connected, useful, and impactful well beyond the original project.",

    "text": "What kind of things fit into Darwin Core?\n\n\n\n\nData types that fit Darwin Core\n\n\nGenerally speaking, Darwin Core can accommodate observations of biological organisms. In the image above are some of the data types that have already used Darwin Core to publish to repositories like OBIS and GBIF.\n\n\n\nThe Darwin Core Archive - a unit of data sharing\n\nBefore we get into the nitty-gritty of Darwin Core, let’s talk about the Darwin Core Archive.\n\n\n\nDarwin Core Archive structure\n\n\nThe Darwin Core Archive is the practical, long-lasting “package” for Darwin Core and for sharing biodiversity data. It is a zip file, ready to stand the test of time. Inside are tables of data (e.g., CSV files) where the columns are Darwin Core terms, describing record-level details (like species names, dates, and locations). A separate EML file (Ecological Metadata Language) provides the dataset-level story: who collected it, when, why, and how the pieces belong together. This combination makes the archive both technically solid and human-understandable, ensuring your data remains useful well into the future.\n\n\nWhat about things that don’t fit into Darwin Core?\nInvariably, scientists measure variables that are unique to their data. So how do we share these in a standardized way? The folks at OBIS came up with a nice extension to Darwin Core that does just that—it’s called the Extended Measurement or Fact (eMoF) extension.\nAs you’ll see in the example from the Animal Telemetry Network (ATN), sometimes communities have strong standards in place, like the Movebank Attribute Dictionary, which prescribes standard definitions for variables related to telemetry. The eMoF extension allows for these to be put into a generalized, standard structure so that they can interoperate and be reused with standards from other communities, like the Climate and Forecast (CF) Standard Names.",

    "text": "Darwin Core Basics\nOK, we’re ready for some nitty-gritty. Darwin Core is essentially a list of terms you can use as column headers in your data. Of course, these terms can also be used in more sophisticated structures than spreadsheets, like relational databases, but let’s keep it simple for now.\nAn example of this is describing the date some data was collected. If we don’t use Darwin Core, you might call it date and I might call it collection day. If we agree to use Darwin Core, we know it will be eventDate and we will never have to discuss it.\n\n\n\nSingle Darwin Core term example\n\n\n\nExample Term\nFor example, in Darwin Core, countryCode is a standard term that describes that a particular observation happened in a country. You describe them via two-letter country codes (like US for the United States or CA for Canada).\nAlthough there are many good arguments for using standards early in your data workflow, you don’t have to create an entirely new workflow; you can map to countryCode, and other Darwin Core terms, anywhere in your data process. That way, whether you’re collecting records in the field, managing them in a database, or publishing them online, the meaning stays consistent and others will immediately understand what that field represents.\n\n\nWhat is required?\nOne of the most frequent questions we get is which terms are required in Darwin Core? The answer is none. The standard does not prescribe requirements, however repositories like OBIS and GBIF do.\nFor example, OBIS requires:\n\neventID\neventDate\ndecimalLatitude\ndecimalLongitude\noccurrenceID\noccurrenceStatus (e.g., present/absent)\nbasisOfRecord (e.g., HumanObservation)\nscientificName\n\nWhen you look at those requirements, they’re rather simple:\n\nwhat did you see: scientificName\nwhen: eventDate\nwhere: decimalLatitude/decimalLongitude\ndid you see it, how did you see it: basisOfRecord\nhow do we reference this record: eventID and occurrenceID\n\nBut if that’s all the information Darwin Core communicated, it wouldn’t be very useful. On the next page we look at some specific examples. It comes down to what your scientific community expects of you. For example, it might be normal to collect the sex of the species in your field. In that case, it’s best to include sex as a term.",

    "text": "Example: Hypothetical Fisheries Trawl Data\n\n\n\nTrawl data mapping overview\n\n\nHere we share data from a hypothetical fisheries trawl survey. In Darwin Core, these data would be coordinated over a couple of tables to describe the core data (what, when, where) and the additional data, like experimental and environmental covariates that are specific to this data type and study. Here, we’ve broken these up into a few different tables to make them easier to view.\n\n\n\nTemporal data mapping\n\n\nLet’s start on the left, with ‘When’. This table demonstrates how variable names like ‘Date’ and ‘Time’ map to the Darwin Core terms eventDate and eventTime fairly directly. With trawl data, these might be captured as ‘Start’ and ‘Stop’ times, and that range can be captured within the ISO 8601 format that is used in Darwin Core.\nWhat may not be obvious is that Darwin Core events can be structured hierarchically, so individual time points, or ranges, can exist within parent events.\n\n\n\nSpatial data mapping\n\n\nLike the When table, there is a fairly straightforward mapping of spatial coordinates to the Darwin Core standard. For many people, they can use decimal degrees taken directly from a GPS system. Others may need to convert from degrees-minutes-seconds to decimal degrees.\nWhat do you do when you want to describe a transect, as is common in trawl data? Darwin Core offers the term footprintWKT, which allows description of 2-D and 3-D shapes as Well Known Text (WKT). This can include polygons, lines, circles, and other shapes.\nLastly, Darwin Core allows both minimum and maximum depth to be captured, although you may need to convert your data to meters.\n\n\n\nBiological data mapping\n\n\nNow we finally get to the biological part of our data. A trawl might return many species. Darwin Core allows these to be described via scientificName (any level of classification, not just species) and scientificNameID (corresponding to a database ID like a WoRMS AphiaID or ITIS TSN).\nindividualCount can be described, or if you have non-count units, organismQuantity and organismQuantityUnit can be used to describe another unit that appropriately describes the catch in terms of Catch Per Unit Effort (CPUE).\nLastly, each of these descriptions would be given an eventID or occurrenceID to identify this specific observation. This is like a primary key in a SQL database.\n\n\n\nExtended Measurement or Fact data\n\n\nHow does Darwin Core capture the information that might be specific to this study that might not be common across all of biology? It uses extensions, especially the Extended Measurement or Fact extension. In this way, any measurement or variable can be linked to any event or occurrence. Our example here shows temperature. Below we show a more unusual example from satellite telemetry.\nThis table reads differently than the others. In this case we have the Darwin Core terms in the left column and an example value in the right column. We name the variable in the measurementType, and use measurementTypeID to link it to a corresponding URL definition that can be read by a computer.\nSimilarly, we break unit into a name and ID so computers can efficiently and correctly coordinate these data with other data. If we have information on properties like accuracy, methodology, and who recorded this information, we can record that as well.",

    "text": "Example: Satellite Telemetry Data\n\n\n\nATN data mapping overview\n\n\nHere is another example: data from the Animal Telemetry Network (ATN), which deploys satellite tags on animals to track their movement.\n\n\n\nDeployment event data\n\n\nWe included this example to demonstrate how a parent event, like the entire deployment of a tag, can be described separately from children events and occurrences. Here, eventDate describes the full time range of all the satellite pings (individual occurrences) that happened during the deployment. minimumDepthInMeters and maximumDepthInMeters are appropriately recorded as 0m because all pings happen at the surface.\nSince the deployment is not a single point, it is described as a MULTIPOINT using footprintWKT.\nLastly, samplingProtocol is a generic description here, but it could just as easily reference a DOI from a published protocol or paper.\n\n\n\nIndividual occurrence data\n\n\nHere is an example of an occurrence, or individual ping from the tracked animal. Some noteworthy terms we haven’t seen yet include organismID to identify a specific animal that is tracked for a long time.\nassociatedReferences points the user to the corresponding publication.\nbibliographicCitation describes how this individual data point should be cited if, for example, it is mixed with data from another dataset.\nFinally, occurrenceRemarks gives us a place to note that this is a representative point from the full dataset, which can be found at NOAA’s NCEI.\n\n\n\nATN eMoF extension data\n\n\nLet’s look at how the Extended Measurement or Fact extension looks here, as a table. Whereas in the previous example we were looking at how a single variable is broken down, here we see how multiple variables are linked to a single occurrence. A new facet to these data is that they are referencing another standard, the Movebank Attribute Dictionary. The telemetry and tracking community have already agreed to use these terms to describe specific attributes about variables like tag make and model, or tag placement. Rather than reinvent the wheel, we simply map to them so machines can be leveraged to coordinate these data with other data referencing Movebank attributes.",
