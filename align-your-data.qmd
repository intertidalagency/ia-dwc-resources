There are many paths to the top of the mountain.
See the [resources page](docs/resources.html) to view how others have shared their data with Darwin Core.


### Consider incremental and strategic incorporation of standards.

It can pay to keep local structures aligned with standards that are useful downstream of collection.

But, you may already have systems in place for collecting and working with your data.  Consider improving them by selectively working toward a standards-based system. Already standards based? Consider mapping to Darwin Core and publishing a Darwin Core Archive so that the data can be found and reused by the biodiversity science community.

## Steps to alignment

What does it look like to map existing data to Darwin Core? Here we share a hypothetical example of a fisheries trawl, and and another of satellite telemetry data from the ATN.
