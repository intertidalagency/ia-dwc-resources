*A technical specification that details the structure, organization, documentation, and format of data.*


## Why use a data standard? 

By implementing standards we go from data to regional syntheses efficiently

- Using data standards allows for the consistent collection of data, and aids in data aggregation, sharing and reuse, and interoperability of that data across different systems, sources, and users.
- Data standards can save time and effort if used during data collection, but may be applied at other points in the data life cycle by restructuring and re-documenting the data.
