## What is a data standard?

*A technical specification that details the structure, organization, documentation, and format of data.*

Technical data standards pertain to organizing the data and documenting how data was collected; they do not provide guidelines for how data should be collected. They are usually machine-testable, and enable machines to exchange data.  


## Why use a data standard? 

In studying the US Atlantic ocean, implementing standards enable us to go from data to regional syntheses efficiently.  

- Using data standards allows for the consistent collection of data, and aids in data aggregation, sharing and reuse, and interoperability of that data across different systems, sources, and users.
- Data standards can save time and effort if used during data collection, but may be applied at other points in the data life cycle by restructuring and re-documenting the data.
